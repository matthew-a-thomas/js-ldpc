# js-ldpc
A JavaScript implementation of a Low-Density Parity-Check code.

The goal of this project is to create an implementation of an LDPC (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-density_parity-check_code) because an existing one doesn't seem readily available.

Robert Gallager's original paper on the topic can be found here: http://www.rle.mit.edu/rgallager/documents/ldpc.pdf
